## üöÄEmbedding Machine learning Model using Gradio Framework ü§ñ üöÄ üöÄ

This project demonstrates the incorporation of a machine learning model into a graphical user interface (GUI) using [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) framework. The aim is to create an interactive interface that assists a telecommunications company in managing customer churn. This application was collaboratively developed as part of the Azubi Africa Data Science Training program.

## Features ‚õëÔ∏è

**Intelligent Customer Churn Prediction:** Users can input customer attributes such as gender, tenure, internet service type, contract, and more. The machine learning model processes these inputs and provides a prediction about whether the customer is likely to churn or not.

**Instant Prediction Output**: Upon submitting the customer details, the app instantly displays the prediction outcome. If the model predicts that the customer is likely to churn, the output is displayed as "Customer Churn." If not, the output is displayed as "Customer Not Churn."

**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The Gradio app provides a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to interact with a machine learning model trained to aid the prediction of a Telco Customer Churn.

## Usage Instructions üßë‚Äçüè´

**Input Customer Details:**
Fill out the customer attributes in the input fields. You can select options from dropdowns and enter numerical values as required.

**View Churn Prediction:**
After entering the customer details, click the "Predict" button. The app will process the information and display the churn prediction in the output section. The prediction will be either "Customer Churn" or "Customer Not Churn."

**Explore Different Scenarios:**
Feel free to experiment with different customer attribute combinations to see how they affect the churn prediction. The app provides instant feedback for each scenario.

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

**Invalid Input Values:** Ensure that you are entering valid input values in the provided fields. Make sure to follow the specified data type and range for each input. For example, ensure that numerical inputs like "Monthly Charges" and "Total Charges" are within the specified range.

**Library Versions:** Double-check that you have installed the required libraries with the correct versions as mentioned in the README file. Incorrect library versions can lead to compatibility issues and unexpected behavior.

**Missing Libraries:** If you encounter import errors or missing module issues, make sure that all required libraries are properly installed in your Python environment. You can use the provided requirements.txt file to install the required dependencies.

**NB**: you encounter any issues with the app, ensure that you have the required libraries installed and that the "my_exported_components.pkl" file is in the correct location.
